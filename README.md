# PwdLeakCheck
To check how strong are our passwords...

In General, while signing up we setup our passwords but we need to think - Is this password good enough/ isn't it presnet in the list of hacked passwords?

Well, while setting up the passwords we will only get to know how strong is our new passowrd but we can't know whether it is present in list of hacked passwords.

Don't worry, we have PwdLeakCheck now... Just enter your password and check how many times it had been hacked.
