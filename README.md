# PwdLeakCheck
To check how strong our passwords are...
This will help you know how many times your password had been hacked if it is found in the list of hacked passwords.

**APPENDIX**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In General, while signing up we setup our passwords but we need to think - Is this password good enough/ isn't it present in the list of hacked passwords?

Well, while setting up the passwords we will only get to know how strong is our new password but we can't know whether it is present in list of hacked passwords.

Don't worry, we have [PwdLeakCheck](https://github.com/KrishAleti/PwdLeakCheck/blob/main/PwdLeakCheck.py) now... Just enter your password and check is it okay to
use or how many times it had been hacked.

Wooo!!! The best feature is the usage of CLI (Command Line Interface), we can give any number of passwords to perform the check with a click.

Well, we get to know about our password uniqueness by this but... The user may need another chance to check his newly decided password.
It is a good practice to give a chance to the user to enter another password if the previous password is found in the list of hacked passwords.

Again, it depends on the individual's interest. If the password is found in the list of hacked passwords and still the user wants to discontinue, user can simply
enter "STOP" when it is prompted to Enter a new password. Once "STOP" is entered the program will be terminated.

Well!! Those functions are now implemented and ready to use (CLI is not used here) ---> [PwdLeakCheck2.0](https://github.com/KrishAleti/PwdLeakCheck/blob/main/PwdLeakCheck2.0.py)

**Excited???** 

Click [PwdLeakCheck](https://github.com/KrishAleti/PwdLeakCheck/blob/main/PwdLeakCheck.py) to check multiple passwords with a click from the Command Prompt/CLI.

Click [PwdLeakCheck2.0](https://github.com/KrishAleti/PwdLeakCheck/blob/main/PwdLeakCheck2.0.py) to check your passwords one by one.
